This Student Management System project is a Spring Boot application that provides CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for managing student data. It uses Spring Data JPA for database interactions, MySQL as the database, and features RESTful API endpoints to add, retrieve, update, and delete student records. The project demonstrates key backend development concepts and can be easily tested using tools like Postman or Swagger. Future enhancements include front-end integration, authentication, and advanced features like pagination and sorting. This system serves as a robust foundation for learning and implementing full-stack applications.
